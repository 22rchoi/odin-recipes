        <h2>Be a Gourmet(sabzi)</h2>
        <p>This khormesh, or stew, is often called Iran's <em>national</em> 
        dish</p>
        <p>The different herbs - fenugreek leaves, omari limes, and more - 
        all mix to form a delicious and <strong>complex</strong> flavor.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>1 1/2 pounds lamb shoulder or beef chuck</strong> 
            - trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>1 teaspoon</strong> - ground turmeric, sea salt, and freshly
            ground black pepper</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>3 tablespoons</strong> plus <strong>1/4 cup</strong>
            extra-virgin olive oil</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Polo Ba Tahdig</strong> (Persian Rice With Bread Crust)</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Mast-o Khiar</strong> or plain yogurt</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, time for the <em>herbs</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>1/2</strong> cup dried kidney beans, <strong>
            1 tablespoon</strong> dried fenugreek leaves, <strong>1/4 teaspoon
            </strong> crumbled saffron threads</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>1 pound</strong> Italian parsley, <strong>1 pound</strong>
            cilantro (about 3 large bunches each)</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>1</strong> large yellow onion, thinly sliced, <strong>2</strong>
            bunches chives, <strong>1</strong> bunch scallions, roots trimmed,
            and <strong>4</strong> Omari(dried Persian) limes, punctured 
            multiple times with a fork</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>In a medium bowl, season the meat with turmeric, 
            <strong>2 teaspoons</strong> salt and <strong>1/2 teaspoon</strong>
            pepper. Set aside for later</p></li>
            <li><p>Rinse the beans and place in another medium bowl with
            <strong>1 cup</strong> water and a generous pinch of salt. Set
            aside to soak for <strong>30 minutes</strong></p></li>
            <li><p>Meanwhile, place a large Dutch oven/pot over medium-high
            heat, and add <strong>3 tablespoons</strong> oil.
            When it shimmers, add meat and cook, turning regularly so that
            it browns evenly, for about <strong>15 minutes.</strong>
            Once the meat has browned, move it to the edges of the pot and add
            the onion along with some salt to the center of the pot. Caramelize the 
            onion, <strong>8 to 10 minutes.</strong></p></li>
            <li><p>Drain the beans and add to the pot, stir to combine everything.
            Add <strong>4 cups</strong> of water, increase heat to a boil. Then, reduce
            heat to medium-low, and let it simmer for <strong>2 hours</strong></p></li>
            <li><p>While waiting, prepare the herbs - wash them, remove the stems -
            and chop the leaves/stems <em>very, very</em> finely. The more finely chopped
            the <strong>stronger</strong> the ghormeh sabzi.</p></li>  
            <li><p>Separately chop the chives and scallions(including the 
            green tops) as <em>finely</em> as possible by hand</p></li> 
            <li><p>Set a large frying pan over medium heat and once it's hot,
            add the remaining <strong>1/4 cup</strong> oil and scallion-chive mixture.
            Allow it to wilt, then add all remaining chopped herbs, crushing 
            fenugreek leaves between your fingers as you add them. Cook, stirring
            continuously, until the herbs are wilted and <em>very</em> dark
            green, and give off a bright green oil when pressed with a spoon.
            This step'll take 18-20 minutes, and is crucial to the flavor and color
            of the stew. </p></li> 
            <li><p>When the meat has cooked for <strong>2 hours</strong>, add
            the cooked herb mixture, Omari limes, and <strong>1/2 cup</strong>
            water. Season with salt and bring to a boil, then reduce, and let
            simmer for <strong>1 hour</strong>. Check on limes to make
            sure they're submerged in the stew but not falling apart. If still floating
            after <strong>20 minutes</strong>, gently push them into the stew</p></li>
            <li><p>As the stew nears the <strong>3-hour</strong> mark, remove
            the lid and check the meat; it should be tender, but if the stew seems 
            watery, leave it uncovered and reduce. Taste and adjust
            with salt and pepper, and if acidity is needed, juice some lime into
            it until sufficiently tangy. Stir in the saffron, and at the end, the stew
            should be a very deep, <strong>dark</strong> shade of green and quite
            thick. Return dried limes into the stew to serve.</p></li>
            <li><p>Serve hot with the Persian rice and mast-o khiar</p></li>
