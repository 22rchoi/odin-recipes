        <p>Baby zucchini filled with ground meat, onions, and pine nuts, cooked in a silky, garlicky, and minty yogurt sauce.  
        </p>
        <p>At the end, you'll have a delicious meal served with a side of warm rice.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>The Zucchini</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>2 kg</strong> baby zucchini(kousa)</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>1</strong> recipe of <a href="./hashweh.html">Hashweh</a></p></li>
            <li><p><strong>1 L</strong> vegetable/other neutral oil with a 
            high smoke point</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Yogurt sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>1.5 kg</strong> plain full-fat yogurt</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>1</strong> head garlic, smashed or minced finely</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>1 tbsp</strong> dried mint, <strong>2 tbsp</strong>
            labneh(strained yogurt), <strong>4 tbsp</strong> corn starch
            <strong>3 tbsp</strong> vegetable oil, <strong>2 tsp</strong>
            salt</p></li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Core the zucchini, taking out as much of the insides
        <em>as possible</em>, while being careful to not puncture a hole
        through the sides</p></li>
        <li><p>Scoop in the Hashweh into the emptied zucchini with a spoon
        and push it down with your thumb, until its as full as possible
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Add oil to a stockpot a couple inches high and heat
        to 350F/180C. Fry the stuffed zucchini in batches, turning occasionally,
        until it's golden on all side(it'll take around 5 minutes). Drain on a
        paper towel-lined baking sheet. Zucchini can be reserved in the fridge or
        freezer at this point if dividing the cooking tasks across multiple days
        </p></li>
        <li><p>On the day of serving, bring about <strong>1 L</strong>
        of water to a boil with the garlic, mint, and salt. Add the fried
        zucchini and simmer until fully cooked, taking around <strong>
        3-5 minutes</strong>. If your fingernail easily pierces the flesh,
        then it's ready. Strain, reserve the liquid.</p></li>
        <li><p>Get a stainless steel stockpot. Combine <strong>2 tbsp</strong>
        of water with the corn starch in a small bowl. Add the yogurt, labneh,
        and corn starch/water mixture to the pot over high heat. Using
        a whisk, mix constantly and let it boil for about a minute to activate
        the corn starch.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the zucchini cooking liquid to the yogurt mixture steadily until
        it reaches desired consistency, almost like a thick soup. It will also
        thicken up a bit with additional cooking.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bring it back up to a boil and add the zucchini. Cook
        for about <strong>2-3 minutes</strong> or until heated through.
        Adjust seasoning(if needed), and serve with rice.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>And with that, you're done! If you want to store leftovers, cool everything
    completely before covering and refrigerating. To reheat, bring to a gentle
    simmer over the stove, thinning the sauce with water if needed.
