        <h2><em>Pho'cking delicious mate!</em></h2>
            <p>Pho is, without a doubt, the <strong>most</strong> popular
            food associated with Vietnam. 
            <p>In this recipe, I'll be focusing on Beef Pho's easier-to-make(but just as delicious!), lesser-known 
            cousin, Chicken Pho!</p>
        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
            <p><h3>The Broth</h3></p>
            <ul>     
                <li><p><strong>Chicken</strong> - use thighs, or even a whole chicken!
                Don't substitute the meat with chicken breast, since the broth needs 
                dark meat and skin for maximum <em>flavor</em></p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Spices</strong> - cloves, fennel, star anise, coriander, and
                black cardamom. Give the broth that beloved, distinct Pho fragrance</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Onions and ginger</strong> - traditional aromatics to
                add a <em>hint</em> of smokiness to the broth</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Fish sauce</strong> - this'll make the broth more 
                <em>complex</em>, and give it a <strong>deeper</strong> flavor</p>
                </li>
                <li><p><strong>Sugar</strong> - Pho broth is actually a bit sweet, 
                and even though this usually goes unnoticed, if you don't use sugar, the
                broth'll seem lacking</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p><h3>The Toppings</h3></p>
            <p>Not all of these are needed, but try to get at least 2 or 3 for
            that <em>fresh</em> herb quality characteristic of Vietnamese food.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Lime, coriander/cilantro, green onion, thai basil, mint, beansprouts,
            noodles, or chili(if you're feeling <em>spicy</em>)</strong>
            </p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <p><li><strong>Char onion and ginger</strong> and don't be afraid, 
                burn these well to provide a subtle smokey fragrance signature to Pho broth!</li></p>
                <p><li><strong>Simmer everything <em>GENTLY</em> for 1.5 hrs</strong>
                to infuse the water with all those incredible flavourings</li></p>
                <p><li><strong>Strain,</strong> shred chicken, serve with Toppings!</li></p>
            </ol>
        <p>And that's it! Now, the only thing to do is to pho'ly enjoy your meal.</p>
